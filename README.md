### Project Overview

Title: _"New York City Blog"_

> GitHub: [link](https://github.com/albchia/New-York-City-Blog.git)

This is a common flow for front-end web developers: typically provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to a functional actual website.

The design prototype used for this project is inspired by a descriptive blog. The task is to create the very basic and simple structure of a blog, using various semantic HTML elements. CSS is used only to give a more beautiful basic structure of the blog page

### Project Instructions

Feel free to customize information and style the webpage.

It's time to create a blog to show off the City.
In this Codecademy Pro project, we are going to practice various semantic HTML elements, so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world.

There are some CSS elements only to add sme style to the page.
